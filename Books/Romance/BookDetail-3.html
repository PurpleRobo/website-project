			<p class="bookDesc">Online sales only, since 2002. I am a longtime collector and accumulator of good books in my fields of interest, mainly science fiction and fantasy, vintage paperbacks, early Canadian paperbacks, and pulp magazines. By no means do I limit myself to those categories, and seek out interesting books in all fields at every opportunity. Now, the time has come to share my finds. I still have thousands of books to put online, mainly science fiction paperbacks, pulps and digests, so please visit me again from time to time to see if I have something of interest, or send me your wants. I go to great pains to describe condition accurately, listing all flaws, sometimes with the result that the book description may not look all that attractive. Often, the book is better than my detailed nit-picking would indicate, so please contact me if you have any concerns or questions on the condition of a book. Images of the actual book for sale are included with all listings.
